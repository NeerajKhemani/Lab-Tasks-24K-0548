Wrong value is displayed in output because in the code the value is defined as integer.
It can only store 4-bits of data and the value is larger than 4-bits.
This problem can be solved by defining the value as an long integer.
In the following way:

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    long testInteger=3000000000; 
    printf("Number is %ld",testInteger);
}
